Cholera, *Vibrio cholerae*, and *V. cholerae* Lineages
======================================================

Introduction
------------

This chapter will give you an overview of cholera, the species *Vibrio cholerae*, the main lineages of *V. cholerae*, and the most current pandemic lineage of *V. cholerae*, 7PET.

Acute Watery Diarrhoea, the Disease Cholera and its Epidemiology
----------------------------------------------------------------

Cholera is a disease characterised by acute watery diarrhoea. It is an infection caused by a water-borne bacterium
called *Vibrio cholerae*, a curved Gram-negative rod.

The *V. cholerae* bacterium is usually tranmitted by the faecal-oral route, that is, 
people usually catch cholera by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated
with human faeces containing *V. cholerae*.

Cholera outbreaks typically occur in places where there is poor access
to clean water and poor sewage infrastructure. These include low-income settings in which there is poor water sanitation infrastructure, 
or places in which there is a humanitarian crisis (e.g. an earthquake or war) that has disrupted the water sanitation infrastructure.

Once ingested by a human host, the *V. cholerae* bacteria multiply in the human intestine. The
bacteria attach to the epithelial cells of the intestine and release cholera toxin. Cholera toxin
binds to the intestinal epithelial cell surface, and stimulates the cells to secrete ions and water into
the intestinal lumen, resulting in acute watery diarrhoea.

Note that *V. cholerae* is not the only pathogen that can cause acute watery diarrhoea; similar symptoms also be caused by other bacteria
such as enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC). 

The Species *Vibrio cholerae* and its Geographic Distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------

The species *V. cholerae* is distributed globally, and is a very diverse species with many different lineages. Importantly, at present there is actually
only one lineage of *V. cholerae* which causes epidemic cholera, and we will discuss this lineage (known as
'7PET') in more detail below. There are many other lineages of *V. cholerae* found around the world that do not cause epidemic
cholera. These other lineages are often found in brackish water or saltwater in association with shellfish
such as crabs and shrimp, or in rivers or freshwater lakes (see `Nasreen et al 2020`_).

The History of Cholera
----------------------

A disease that sounds like cholera was recorded in ancient India and China. Since the early 1800s there have
been seven historically recorded cholera pandemics caused by *Vibrio cholerae*. The 7th pandemic is the current
and ongoing cholera pandemic. There were six previous historically recorded pandemics since the early 1800s.
The 6th pandemic occurred from 1899 to 1923, after which there were only localised outbreaks in Asia for several decades,
and then the 7th pandemic started in 1961 and continues at present (see `Feng et al 2008`_). 

.. _Feng et al 2008: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19115014/

A key difference between the 6th pandemic and the 7th pandemic was in a laboratory phenotype known as the 'biotype', which
is based on particular laboratory tests. *V. cholerae* isolates collected from cholera patients at the start of the 7th pandemic
in the early 1960s were found to differ in the results of these biochemical laboratory tests compared to *V. cholerae* isolates collected from
cholera patients in the earlier 6th pandemic. Because of that, the 7th pandemic isolates were described as having the
'El Tor biotype', to distinguish them from earlier form of *V. cholerae* causing the 6th pandemic, which were described to as having
the 'Classical biotype'. These biotypes are based on a set of laboratory tests, for example, a test for the ability to lyse red blood cells, 
a biochemical test called the Voges-Proskaeur reaction that tests for the presence of a specific fermentation pathway, and
a laboratory test for resistance to an antibiotic called polymyxin B, amongst other tests (see `CDC 1994`_). What all
this revealed was the 7th pandemic was caused by a lineage of *V. cholerae* that was substantially different at the genetic level c
ompared to the *V. cholerae* that caused the earlier 6th pandemic.

Introduction to the *V. cholerae* Genome
----------------------------------------

-brief mention that the V. cholerae genome was first published in 2000 by Heidelberg et al PMID:10952301;
-brief mention of the genome size, 2 chromosomes (see Fig. 1 of Mutreja & Dougan 2000), number of genes, possible presence of the cholera toxin genes that are found as part of the cholera prophage region, possible presence of plasmids containing AMR genes


Lineages of *V. cholerae*
-------------------------

-clear explanation of tree for the V. cholerae species (Domman et al 2017 Americas paper) showing the lineages ( explain trees)
-brief mention of the lineages’ geographic distribution (non-7PET lineages found in coastal and fresh water around the world, 7PET found in humans) and role in cholera and diarrhoeal illness; brief mention that epidemic/pandemic cholera is caused by 7PET and spread by human travel & poor sanitation, and that non-7PET lineages only cause very small outbreaks that don’t reach large numbers and so are only of minor public health concern;


7PET
----

-its emergence in the 1960s, its very high virulence & very high transmissibility; its causing the 7th pandemic and causing all large cholera outbreaks & epidemics since the 1960s; brief mention of the need for a rapid public health response (WASH, treatment centres, contact tracing, public information campaign, vaccination, etc.) as soon as possible at the start of a 7PET outbreak, to contain/reduce/stop it;
-brief mention of serogroup as a likely virulence factor, and that 7PET usually has O1 (mostly) or O139 serogroup (sometimes), but that some other lineages are also O1 or O139;
-a brief history of the global spread of the current pandemic lineage (7PET), including mention of the Bay of Bengal being a region where cholera is endemic and from where 7PET has spread around the world, and brief history of introductions of 7PET into Africa; brief mention of countries worldwide where 7PET is now endemic;
-brief mention of how 7PET has split into sublineages, and brief mention that new sublineages have arisen over time in the Bay of Bengal region and spread around the world; brief mention of names of sublineages previously or currently found in Africa;
-the recently revised GTFCC definitions of cholera cases and ‘cholera-free’ country statuses;
-brief mention that 7PET can be controlled by vaccination; that vaccines have high efficiency against 7PET but are in short supply and that genomic information has great potential to help us decide who to vaccine (e.g. populations exposed to 7PET, especially those exposed to multi-drug resistant 7PET sublineages)


Brief Summary of Take-home Messages
-----------------------------------

The key take-home messages of this chapter are that 7PET is the high-risk lineage of *Vibrio cholerae*; that whole genome sequencing can be used to determine whether a new outbreak of diarrhoeal illness is 7PET or not; and that a 7PET outbreak requires a rapid and large public health response. 

Suggested Further Reading
-------------------------

Suggested further reading to go with this chapter is the nice review by `Mutreja & Dougan 2020`_ on "Molecular epidemiology and intercontinental spread of cholera".
