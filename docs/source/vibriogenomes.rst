Cholera, *Vibrio cholerae*, and *V. cholerae* Lineages
======================================================

Introduction
------------

This chapter will give you an overview of cholera, the species *Vibrio cholerae*, the main lineages of *V. cholerae*, and the current pandemic lineage of *V. cholerae*, 7PET.

Acute Watery Diarrhoea, the Disease Cholera and its Epidemiology
----------------------------------------------------------------

Cholera is a disease characterised by acute watery diarrhoea, leading to rapidly progressing dehydration and shock (`Sack et al 2004`_).
If you are interested in how cholera is diagnosed, the World Health Organisation provides guidance and 
precise definitions of what they consider 'a suspected cholera case' and 'a confirmed cholera case' (see `WHO 2023`_).

Cholera is an infection caused by a bacterium called *Vibrio cholerae*, a curved Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium (Figure 1).

The *V. cholerae* bacterium is usually transmitted by the faecal-oral route, that is, 
people usually catch cholera by eating food or by drinking water that has been contaminated
with human faeces containing *V. cholerae* (Figure 2). Barriers to disease transmission include
handwashing and hygiene, access to toilets, and clean drinking water (e.g. chlorination of stored water) `Nelson et al 2009`_.

  Figure 2. Life cycle of the current pandemic lineage of *V. cholerae*. On ingestion of *V. cholerae* of the current pandemic lineage in 
contaminated food or water, the *V. cholerae* bacteria colonise the small intestine, multiply, secrete cholera toxin, and are then
shed back into the environment by the host in diarrhoea. The *V. cholerae* bacteria shed in the stool are in a transient hyperinfectious
state that serves to amplify the outbreak by promoting transmission to further human hosts. Image source: A. Coghlan, inspired by
`Nelson et al 2009`_. 

.. _Nelson et al 2009: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19756008/

Cholera outbreaks typically occur in places where there is poor access
to clean water and poor sewage infrastructure (Figure 3). These include low-income settings in which there is poor water sanitation infrastructure, 
or places in which there is a humanitarian crisis (e.g. an earthquake or war) that has disrupted the water sanitation infrastructure.
Examples are Haiti, where there was a cholera epidemic from 2010-2019 which began shortly after a massive earthquake occurred in 2010, 
and Yemen, which has suffered a cholera epidemic from 2016-present during its ongoing civil war.

Once ingested by a human host, the *V. cholerae* bacteria multiply in the human intestine. The
bacteria attach to the epithelial cells of the intestine and release **cholera toxin** (abbreviated as Ctx, CTX, or CT; Figure 4). Cholera toxin 
binds to the intestinal epithelial cell surface, and stimulates the cells to secrete ions and water into
the intestinal lumen, resulting in acute watery diarrhoea. Cholera toxin is therefore the key **virulence factor** 
of *V. cholerae*.

Note that *V. cholerae* is not the only pathogen that can cause acute watery diarrhoea; similar symptoms also be caused by other bacteria
such as enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC). 

The Species *Vibrio cholerae* and its Geographic Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------- 

Like other bacteria, *V. cholerae* populations are primarily **clonal**, as they reproduce by cell division, with the
DNA (genetic material) of descendant cells being identical to the DNA of the parent cells. Mutations (changes) in the DNA, are
the main source of genetic variation in *V. cholerae*; these sometimes occur when DNA is being copied during cell division, but
can also occur due to other types of DNA damage (e.g. due to UV radiation).

Over evolutionary time, different clones of *V. cholerae* have independently accumulated
mutations, and they are now distinguishable at the genetic level, so that we consider them different **lineages** (Figure 5). 

.. figure:: ClonalSpecies.png
  :width: 350

  Figure 5. The population structure of a bacterial species can contain genetically distinguishable lineages. Five different
lineages are represented by the circles of five different colours (blue, orange, green, pink, red).

The species *V. cholerae* is distributed globally, and is a very diverse species with many different lineages.
The bacteria belonging to one particular *V. cholerae* lineage are all relatively **clonal** (highly similar at the genetic level);  
all descended from a relatively recent common ancestor (probably sometime in the last few centuries); and
usually present similar biological features, such as specific patterns of virulence. 

There is there is only one lineage of *V. cholerae* which causes pandemic/epidemic cholera at present.
This lineage is known as the **'7PET'** lineage. 
The 7PET lineage is an extremely infectious and virulent lineage of *V. cholerae*, which produces
cholera toxin. 7PET appears to have evolved to become a 
human pathogen (`Feng et al 2008`_, `Chun et al 2009`_, `Hu et al 2016`_, `Mutreja & Dougan 2020`_).

There are many other non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* found around the world that do not cause pandemic/epidemic
cholera. The vast majority of these non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages do not produce cholera toxin.

These non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* are often found in brackish water or in saltwater in association with shellfish such as crabs and shrimp, or in rivers or freshwater lakes.

The History of Cholera: the Seven Historically Recorded Pandemics
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A disease with symptoms like cholera was recorded in ancient texts from ancient India and China, but we have
little information about those ancient outbreaks.
Since the early 1800s there have been seven historically recorded cholera pandemics (epidemics covering a very wide
area of our planet). The 7th pandemic is the current
and ongoing cholera pandemic, and has been caused by the 7PET lineage.

The 6th pandemic occurred from 1899 to 1923, after which there were only localised outbreaks in parts of Asia for several decades,
and then the 7th pandemic started in 1961 and continues at present (`Feng et al 2008`_). 
We now know that the 6th pandemic  
was actually caused by completely a different **lineage** of *V. cholerae* than the 7th pandemic. 
We call the lineage that caused the 6th pandemic the **'Classical lineage'** (`Chun et al 2009`_, `Domman et al 2017`_). 

.. _Domman et al 2017: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29123068/

.. _Chun et al 2009: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19720995/

The Classical lineage has more or less died out since the end of the 6th pandemic (in 1923) 
and is very rarely seen nowadays (e.g. a rare Classical lineage isolate 
from Ghana in 2010 was reported by `Adade et al 2022`_).

Relationships between lineages of *V. cholerae*
-----------------------------------------------

The 7PET lineage, which has caused the current pandemic, and the Classical lineage, which caused the 6th historically
recorded pandemic, are relatively closely related. We know this by making a 'phylogenetic tree' for *V. cholerae*, that is, a
'family tree' of the different lineages (genetically different subtypes) of *V. cholerae*. 
The phylogenetic tree represents our best guess at the relationships between different lineages of *V. cholerae*, based on similarities and
differences between their DNA.

.. _Domman et al 2017: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29123068/

.. figure:: Lineages.png
  :width: 400

  A phylogenetic tree of some of the known lineages of *V. cholerae*. The triangles at the ends of branches represent existing lineages. The red dot represents the last common ancestor of the Classical and 7PET lineages, while the yellow dot represents the last common ancestor of the ELA-3 and 7PET lineages. Image credit: A. Coghlan, based on the tree in Supplementary Figure 2 of `Domman et al 2017`_, and with the addition of information on L3b and L9.

You may have encountered phylogenetic trees before, but if not, don't worry, we will be discussing them a lot in this course.
In this tree, the arrow of time goes from left to right, with the left-hand side of the tree being the furthest back in history and the
very right-hand side of the tree being the present time. The triangles at the right-hand side of the tree different current lineages of *V. cholerae*.

If you look at two of the triangles (representing lineages) at the ends of the branches, e.g. the triangles representing 7PET and Classical, and trace
back along two branches from right to left, you will eventually reach an 'internal node' where those branches meet, further to the left in the tree. This internal
node represents the last common ancestor of the two lineages, e.g.
the last common ancestor of 7PET and Classical (red circle), which is estimated to have lived about 1880 (`Feng et al 2008`_). On the other hand,
the last common ancestor of 7PET and ELA-3 (yellow circle) lived even longer ago, probably 10s or 100s of years before 1880.

.. _Feng et al 2008: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19115014/

What the tree tells us is that 7PET and Classical, the two lineages that have caused pandemics, are relatively closely related *V. cholerae* lineages. 
7PET is also relatively closely related to non-pandemic/non-epidemic-causing lineages of *V. cholerae*, including MX-2, Gulf Coast and ELA-3. 

Later in the course you will be learning a lot about how to build phylogenetic trees yourself, and how to interpret
them to understand about the relationships between different subtypes of 7PET that have caused different 7PET outbreaks, and to
gain insights into how 7PET is spreading regionally and globally. 

Diarrhoeal illness caused by different lineages of *V. cholerae*
----------------------------------------------------------------

The 7PET lineage, which has caused the current pandemic, and the Classical lineage, which caused the 6th historically
recorded pandemic, are only the two pandemic/epidemic-causing lineages of *V. cholerae*. The many other
lineages of *V. cholerae* are not pandemic/epidemic-causing; they sometimes cause relatively small outbreaks of diarrhoeal illness in
tens or even a hundred or so people (`Glenn Morris 1990`_). In contrast, 7PET is the only current *V. cholerae* lineage
that causes large epidemics or pandemics of hundreds of thousands of cases, or even millions of 
cases as seen in the Yemen cholera epidemic from 2016-present (`Mutreja & Dougan 2020`_, `Lassalle et al 2023`_). 

.. _Mutreja & Dougan 2020: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345641/

.. _Glenn Morris 1990: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2286218/

.. _Lassalle et al 2023: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37770747/

Of the non-pandemic/non-epidemic *V. cholerae* lineages, the two lineages that have caused the most cases of diarrhoeal illness
since 2000 are thought to be lineages 'L3b' and 'L9' (`Hao et al 2023`_). For example, these two non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages
have caused several hundred cases of diarrhoeal illness in Hangzhou, China between 2001 and 2018 (`Hao et al 2023`_).
Lineage L3b has also been linked to relatively small outbreaks of diarrhoeal illness in South Africa (`Smith et al 2021`_). 
Note that L3b and L9 correspond to lineages labelled MX-2 and ELA-3, respectively, in the tree above (they are just alternative names used 
for the same lineages).  

.. _Hao et al 2023: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37146742/

.. _Smith et al 2021: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34670657/

.. figure:: L3b_Hangzhou.png
  :width: 600

The grey lines represent the total number of diarrhoeal cases caused by L3b and L9 together, the blue lines represent the number of cases caused by L3b, and the orange lines the number of cases caused by L9. Image credit: `Hao et al 2023`_.

However, compared cholera outbreaks/epidemics caused by 7PET, outbreaks of L3b/L9 and other non-pandemic/non-epidemic
*V. cholerae* lineages are far smaller and in general cause relatively milder diarrhoeal illness (`Glenn Morris 1990`_, `Glenn Morris 2003`_).
In contrast, the cholera epidemic in Yemen that began in 2016 (and is still continuing) has included
approximately million suspected cholera cases and appproximately 4000 deaths from 2016-2020 (`WHO 2020`_).

.. _Glenn Morris 1990: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2286218/

Due to its high virulence (ability to cause acute watery diarrhoea) and pandemic/epidemic-causing potential, the 7PET lineage is of major public health concern,
while the other non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* are in comparison currently only of relatively minor public health concern.
Therefore our focus in this course will be primarily on 7PET, and not the non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae*. 
However, some epidemiologists are monitoring these other non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages, in case at some point in future they 
do evolve to be become far more infectious and/or far more virulent (e.g. `Hao et al 2023`_, `Smith et al 2021`_).

.. _Hao et al 2023: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37146742/

.. _Smith et al 2021: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34670657/

The History of 7PET's Global Spread
-----------------------------------

Although the 7PET lineage is estimated to have split off from the Classical lineage in around 1880 (`Feng et al 2008`_),
it wasn't until 1961 that the 7th pandemic began, with many cases of cholera caused by 7PET occurring in Indonesia (`Hu et al 2016`_, `Mutreja & Dougan 2020`_).
From Indonesia, 7PET spread to the Bay of Bengal region of India and Bangladesh, and from the Bay of Bengal subsequently between the 1960s and 2010 then spread 
throughout the world in three overlapping waves (`Mutreja et al 2011`_). 

.. _Feng et al 2008: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19115014/

.. _Hu et al 2016: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27849586/

.. _Mutreja & Dougan 2020: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345641/

.. figure:: 7PET_Spread.jpg

.. _Mutreja et al 2011: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21866102/

Since 2010, there have been further spread of 7PET, both within countries and regions, and between countries and continents. 
As mentioned above, cholera is spread by the faecal-oral route, and so the most likely explanation is that 7PET has been 
spread by human travel. 

.. figure:: GlobalCholera2023_2024.png

In some regions of Asia and Africa, there are now cholera outbreaks every year, and so cholera is now considered 'endemic'.
These include countries around the Bay of Bengal such as India and Bangladesh. 
Note that the WHO has a technical definition of a 'cholera-endemic area': 'an area where confirmed cholera cases were 
detected during the last 3 years with evidence of local transmission (meaning the cases are not imported from elsewhere)' 
(`WHO 2024`_, accessed 18th July 2024). 

.. _WHO 2024: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera

Note that we have use the terms 'outbreak', 'epidemic' rather loosely here, and not attempted to
provide precise medical or epidemiological definitions. We recommend that you follow WHO guidelines and definitions;
the WHO provides detailed guidance on what it considers to be an 'imported cholera case', a 'locally acquired cholera case', a 'suspected cholera outbreak',
a 'probable cholera outbreak', a 'confirmed cholera outbreak' (see `WHO 2023`_).

The *V. cholerae* Genome and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) of *V. cholerae*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just as for us humans, the genetic material of *V. cholerae* consists of DNA.
The DNA of *V. cholerae* contains all the genetic instructions specifying the development of a *V. cholerae* cell. 

You may be already familiar with the structure of DNA, a famous molecule with a double helix structure. DNA molecules consist of two chains (also known as 'strands') of
smaller molecules called 'nucleotides'. Each nucleotide consists of three parts: a sugar called deoxyribose,
a phosphate group, and one of four 'bases'. The bases are thymine (abbreviated as 'T'), adenine ('A'), guanine ('G')
and cytosine ('C'). 

.. figure:: DNA_structure.jpg
  :width: 300

  A diagram of the structure of DNA, showing the sugar phosphate backbone and base-pairs. The sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the double helix. Image credit: National Human Genome Research Institute, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons.

The bases in the two strands of a DNA double helix are 'complementary' to each other: that is, T pairs with
A and G pairs with C. Thus, if one strand has the sequence of bases TACGA, the other strand must have the sequence
of bases ATGCT. For convenience, one strand in a DNA double helix is called the 'forward' or '+' ('plus') strand, and the 
other strand the 'reverse' or '-' ('minus') strand.

The 'genome' of *V. cholerae* is the name we give to the set of all DNA molecules in a *V. cholerae* cell.
In each cell, the *V. cholerae* genome is organised into two circular 'chromosomes', each consisting of a long circular DNA molecule. 
In total the two circular chromosomes contain about 4 million base-pairs (4 Mb) of base-pairs, where Chromosome 1 is about 3 Mb 
and Chromosome 2 about 1 million base-pairs (1 Mb; `Heidelberg et al 2000`_). 

.. _Heidelberg et al 2000: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10952301/

.. figure:: Chromosomes.png
  :width: 800

  A diagram showing the two circular chromosomes of *V. cholerae*, for a typical 7PET isolate. The outside circles in blue represent protein-coding genes on the forward and reverse strand of the DNA. Between them, the two chromosomes of *V. cholerae* include almost 4000 genes in a typical 7PET isolate from the 7PET lineage. Other key features of the chromosomes are highlighted as green boxes, where the green box labelled '5' is the 'CTX region' containing the two genes *ctxA* and *ctxB*, which encode the A and B subunits of the cholera toxin, respectively. Image source: `Mutreja & Dougan 2020`_.

.. _Mutreja & Dougan 2020: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31345641/

When we talk about 'sequencing the genome' of an organism, we mean figuring out the sequence of
bases on the strands of its DNA molecules. 
Later in this course we will talk about different methods for sequencing DNA.

The first time that a *V. cholerae* isolate's genome was sequenced was in the year 2000, for a *V. cholerae* 7PET strain called N16961 
that was originally isolated in Bangladesh (`Heidelberg et al 2000`_).
Since the year 2000, the genomes of thousands of other *V. cholerae* isolates have been sequenced. There are quite a lot of small differences
between different *V. cholerae* isolates' genomes (that is, there is genetic variation within *V. cholerae*), 
but the majority of *V. cholerae* isolates have two circular chromosomes that together contain about 4 Mb of DNA. 

Genes of *V. cholerae*
----------------------

Each of the two chromosomes of *V. cholerae* includes many hundred of genes. In 
Each gene comprises a segment of its DNA, typically hundreds or thousands
of base-pairs in length. A very common type of gene is a protein-coding gene, which is a stretch of
DNA which encodes (specifies the production of) particular proteins. For example,
*ctxA* and *ctxB* are two *V. cholerae* genes that encode the CtxA and CtxB proteins, the two
proteins that form cholera toxin. In total the two *V. cholerae* chromosomes contain almost 4000 protein-coding genes in a typical isolate
from the 7PET lineage (`Heidelberg et al 2000`_). 

The *ctxA* and *ctxB* genes are usually found close together in the *V. cholerae* genome, in a region known as the **CTX region**. 
Practically 100% of 7PET isolates contain the CTX region in their chromosome, and so produce cholera toxin, and therefore cause a human 
host to suffer acute watery diarrhoea. Only a small number of non-pandemic/non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae*, most
of which are relatively closely related to 7PET (e.g. L3, L9, Gulf Coast, Classical; see above), have *ctxA* and *ctxB* genes (`Chun et al 2009`_, 
`Hao et al 2023`_).
