Cholera genomics
================

Welcome to our free online course on *Vibrio cholerae* genomics!

The aim of this course is to teach you about *V. cholerae* genomics, so that you can use genomics to perform analyses relevant to cholera public health, and extract meaningful insights from *V. cholerae* genomic data. 

This course includes all you want to know about sequencing and analyses of *V. cholerae* genomes, including advanced bioinformatics topics relevant to *V. cholerae* genomics (e.g. genome assembly, phylogenetics, predicting antimicrobial resistance, etc.). 

The course includes both theoretical material and bioinformatics teachings.

Theoretical material on topics relevant to *V. cholerae* genomics includes:

* The disease cholera and its epidemiology.
* The species *Vibrio cholerae*, and its geographic distribution. 
* The history of cholera, and the history of global spread of the current pandemic lineage (7PET lineage).
* Strategies for sample collection and sequencing of *V. cholerae*.
* Isolates, lineages and sublineages of *V. cholerae*, their geographic distribution and role in cholera and diarrhoeal illness.
* Principal features of the *V. cholerae* genome.
* Misleading results from surveilling marker genes and molecular/biochemical tests alone, in the absence of whole-genome sequencing data.
* Sublineages of 7PET, their geographic distribution, spread, and genomic/phenotypic features, and emergence of novel genetic variants in 7PET.
* Pathogenesis of cholera and genetic determinants of virulence, including new variants of concern and variants of interest.
* Cholera treatment and use of antimicrobials.
* Spread of antimicrobial resistance in key lineages (7PET), within and between species.
* How genomics can play a role in public health decisions for cholera, and the potential of genomics as a platform to further refine cholera control strategies (e.g. vaccination strategies).

In each topic, learning will be enriched by examples of *V. cholerae* genome analysis, and practical bioinformatics exercises for learners, with an emphasis on analysing cholera genome data for public health.
