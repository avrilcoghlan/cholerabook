Genomic surveillance for *Vibrio cholerae* using Vibriowatch
============================================================

**Vibriowatch** is a database of high quality genomes and metadata for *Vibrio cholerae*, with robust bioinformatics capability for virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and finding related isolates.

Vibriowatch contains `>4000` published *V. cholerae* genomes, and manually-curated metadata from the literature, including strain names; place, date and source of isolation; and phenotypic data for biotype, serogroup, serotype and antimicrobial resistance.

Vibriowatch is aimed for use by clinicians and public health workers studying cholera outbreaks, as well as for research biologists investigating *V. cholerae* genomic variation and evolution.

Vibriowatch's home is the `PathogenWatch`_ website.

In this tutorial, we will describe how users can use Vibriowatch to:

* upload reads or assembled genomes (which we'll explain in `Assemblies and assembly quality <mlst.rst>`__).
* verifying that their isolate's species is *V. cholerae* (see `Assemblies and assembly quality <mlst.rst>`__).
* view the statistics for their assembly (see see `Assemblies and assembly quality <mlst.rst>`__).
* carry out MLST analysis of their isolate (see `Lineage information <mlst.rst>`__).
* compare their isolate to Vibriowatch's *V. cholerae* reference genomes (see `Lineage information <mlst.rst>`__).
* build a phylogenetic tree to check if their isolate belongs to the pandemic lineage (see `Lineage information <mlst.rst>`__).
* use cgMLST to find closely related isolates (see `Finding closely related isolates <closerelatives.rst>`__).
* build a phylogenetic tree of their isolate and its closest relatives (see `Finding closely related isolates <closerelatives.rst>`__).
* predict virulence genes (see `Predicting virulence genes, antimicrobial resistance genes, and plasmids <virulenceAMR.rst>`__).
* predict antimicrobial resistance genes (see `Predicting virulence genes, antimicrobial resistance genes, and plasmids <virulenceAMR.rst>`__).
* predict plasmids (see `Predicting virulence genes, antimicrobial resistance genes, and plasmids <virulenceAMR.rst>`__).
