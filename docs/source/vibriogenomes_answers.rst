Answers to Questions in Module 1.1
----------------------------------

Here are the answers to the questions in Module 1.1:

#. There is a lot of under-reporting of cholera cases (`Ali et al 2015`_, `Hegde et al 2024`_). In the MSF video, they say it is estimated that only 5-10% of cholera cases are reported to the WHO each year.
#. The MSF video says that in endemic areas, healthy carriers far exceed the percent of people who show symptoms (upon infection with the current pandemic lineage of *V. cholerae*, ie. the 7PET lineage). That it, it is estimated that most people who are infected with the current pandemic lineage (7PET lineage) of *V. cholerae* are asymptomatic (`Nelson et al 2009`_). The percent of people who develop symptoms (e.g. acute watery diarrhoea) probably varies a lot between populations, as populations that have suffered recent outbreaks caused by 7PET likely have greater immunity (`Bencić & Sinha 1972`_, `Nelson et al 2009`_). Asymptomatic carriage is likely responsible for considerable regional and global transmission of the 7PET lineage (`King et al 2008`_, `Islam et al 2017`_).
