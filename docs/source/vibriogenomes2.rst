Module 1.2: Classification of *Vibrio cholerae*
===============================================

Introduction to Module 1.2
--------------------------

Welcome!
In Module 1.2, we will talk about how *Vibrio cholerae* has been historically classified in different ways:
by serogroup, by biotype, and more recently (and most accurately) by analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data.
This module may take you roughly one hour to work through (maybe a bit more or less than that, depending on your own pace).
While we will explain terms as we go along, we have also included a glossary of key terms at the bottom of this webpage. 

Serogroups of *V. cholerae*
---------------------------

The outer membrane of the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria such as *V. cholerae* contains a component known as
'lipopolysaccharide' (LPS) that serves as a barrier to protect the bacteria from external stresses. Lipopolysaccharide
molecules are very large molecules consisting of three parts: an outer core polysaccharide known as the **'O-antigen'**, 
an inner core oligosaccharide, and Lipid A (Figure 10).

Within the species *V. cholerae* there is considerable variation in the surface structure of the O-antigen. 
A subgroup of *V. cholerae* bacteria that share the same distinctive surface structure in their O-antigen are
said to belong to the same **'serogroup'**. Since the 1930s, *V. cholerae* isolates have been classified into 
many different serogroups on the basis of laboratory tests that reflect differences in the interactions of the 
the particular O-antigen produced by each serogroup with serogroup-specific antibodies from the host (`Murase et al 2022`_).
So far 210 different serogroups have been identified within *V. cholerae*, named
O1, O2, O3, ... O210 (`Murase et al 2022`_). To determine whether a particular *V. cholerae* isolate belongs to the O1 serogroup, one can carry out a
relatively rapid laboratory test, to see if the *V. cholerae* cells will agglutinate in O1 antisera (containing anti-O1-antigen antibodies) (`CDC 1994`_); while to determine whether a
*V. cholerae* isolate belongs to the O2 serogroup, one must test for agglutination in O2 antisera (containing anti-O2-antigen antibodies). In other words, the serogroup
is a laboratory phenotype that reflects the surface structure of the O-antigen. 

.. _Murase et al 2022: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35930328/

.. _CDC 1994: https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/52473

Most isolates belonging to the current pandemic lineage (7PET lineage) of *V. cholerae* have the O1 serogroup, while a small fraction of 7PET isolates have serogroup O139 (`Mutreja et al 2011`_,
`Moore et al 2014`_). 
*V. cholerae* isolates that belong to non-epidemic lineages can also sometimes have serogroups O1 or O139, or any of the other >200 known *V. cholerae* serogroups.
Therefore, if a *V. cholerae* isolate from a patient with acute watery diarrhoea is shown via laboratory testing to have serogroup O1 or O139, then there is a strong possibility
that the diarrhoea was caused by 7PET. However, it's important to bear in mind that one can not be 100% sure that the isolate is 7PET, since some non-epidemic 
lineages have serogroups O1 or O139, for example, lineage MX-2 (Figure 8; `Domman et al 2017`_). 

.. _Mutreja et al 2011: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21866102/

.. _Moore et al 2014: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24575898/

.. _Domman et al 2017: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29123068/

Because it is relatively cheap, easy and rapid, laboratory identification of serogroup is currently an important method of predicting whether an isolate is 7PET (`CDC 1994`_, `WHO 2023`_). 
For example, in surveillance units where there is no confirmed cholera outbreak, the WHO currently defines a 'confirmed cholera case' as:

*"Any person infected with Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139 identified by presumptive identification
(culture/seroagglutination) or PCR. The strain should also be demonstrated to be toxigenic (by PCR)
if there is no concomitant confirmed cholera outbreak in other surveillance unit(s) of the country
and there is no established epidemiological link to a confirmed cholera case/ source of exposure
in another country"* (`WHO 2023`_).

.. _CDC 1994: https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/52473

.. _WHO 2023: https://www.gtfcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gtfcc-public-health-surveillance-for-cholera-interim-guidance.pdf

Because isolates of the current pandemic lineage (7PET lineage) have either serogroup O1 or O139,
sometimes the term 'non-O1 *V. cholerae* (NOVC)' or 'non-O1/non-O139 *V. cholerae*'
is used to refer to non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* 
(e.g. `Morris 1990`_). However, it's worth being aware in the back of your mind that 
some non-epidemic lineages of
*V. cholerae* have serogroups O1 or O139, such as MX-2 (Figure 8; `Domman et al 2017`_).

.. _Morris 1990: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2286218/

The Classical Biotype and the El Tor Biotype
--------------------------------------------

In 1905 a doctor named Felix Gotschlich described  *V. cholerae* that had a different set of biochemical characteristics, or 'biotype' than
had been previously observed for *V. cholerae* (reviewed in `Hu et al 2016`_; `Chastel 2007`_). This novel biotype was first seen in the El Tor Quarantine Station in Egypt,
and so the new biotype of *V. cholerae* was named the '**El Tor biotype**', to distinguish it from earlier *V. cholerae* isolates, which were
described as having the '**Classical biotype**'. 
These biotypes are based on a particular set of laboratory tests (about four
or five laboratory tests, depending on the version of the protocol), which test things like susceptibility to infection by particular bacteriophages,
susceptibility to a particular antibiotic, presence of a particular biochemical pathway, and effect on red blood cells (Figure 11; `Cvjetanovic & Barua 1972`_, `CDC 1994`_, `Dorman 2020`_).
Isolates of the 7PET lineage have the El Tor biotype, and in fact the name '7PET' stands for '7th pandemic El Tor'.
In contrast, Classical lineage isolates have the Classical biotype.

  Figure 11. `Summary of V. cholerae O1 biotyping phenotypes`_. Laboratory tests are used to determine the 'biotype' of *V. cholerae*, a laboratory phenotype that can be used to predict whether isolates of the *V. cholerae* causing a particular outbreak belong to the epidemic-causing Classical or 7PET lineages. Isolates of the Classical lineage have the Classical biotype, and isolates of the 7PET lineage have the El Tor biotype.

.. _Summary of V. cholerae O1 biotyping phenotypes: https://www.sanger.ac.uk/theses/md25-thesis.pdf

Although the lineage causing the 7th pandemic, 7PET, shows the El Tor biotype in laboratory tests, some 
non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* also show the El Tor biotype in laboratory biotyping tests (e.g. *V. cholerae* isolates TM11079-80 and 12129(1), which both have the El Tor
biotype and belong to non-epidemic lineages; `Chun et al 2009`_).
Therefore, the biotype is not very useful for distinguishing 7PET from non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae*.
As we will discuss later in this course, whole-genome sequencing tells us far more accurately whether isolates from an
outbreak are 7PET or not.

Note that you may see some mention in the literature of variants of the El Tor biotype, such as
the 'Matlab variants', 'Mozambique variants', 'Haitian variants', 'altered El Tor biotype', 'hybrid El Tor' or 'atypical El Tor' (e.g. in `Bhandari et al 2021`_, 
`Montero et al 2023`_). These variants do not correspond exactly to the El Tor biotype, e.g. they may differ from El Tor in a small number of the laboratory test results in Figure 11.
Isolates with the Matlab/Mozambique/Haitian variants of El Tor biotype or altered/hybrid/atypical El Tor biotype all belong to the 7PET lineage, but
just give slightly different results in the biotyping tests (Figure 11) compared to other 7PET isolates.

Defining *V. cholerae* Lineages Based on Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Data 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 7PET lineage, which has caused the current pandemic, and the Classical lineage, which caused the 6th historically
recorded pandemic, are relatively closely related. We know this by analysing whole-genome sequencing data (that is, genetic information in DNA) in order to make a 'phylogenetic tree' for *V. cholerae*, that is, a tree that depicts the evolutionary relationships between the different lineages of *V. cholerae* and shows how they descended from a common ancestor (Figure 12). 
The phylogenetic tree represents our best guess at the evolutionary relationships between different lineages of *V. cholerae*, based on similarities and
differences between their whole-genome sequences.

  Figure 12. A phylogenetic tree of some of the known lineages of *V. cholerae*. The triangles at the ends of branches represent existing lineages. The red dot represents the last common ancestor of the Classical and 7PET lineages, while the yellow dot represents the last common ancestor of the ELA-3 and 7PET lineages. The tree was based on information in Supplementary Figure 2 and Table S3 of `Domman et al 2017`_, and with the addition of information on the L3b and L9 lineages that are discussed below.

You may have encountered phylogenetic trees before, but if not, don't worry, we will be discussing them a lot in this course, including how to build them based on whole-genome sequencing data.
In this tree, the arrow of time goes from left to right, with the left-hand side of the tree being the furthest back in history and the
very right-hand side of the tree being the present time. The triangles at the right-hand side of the tree represent different current lineages of *V. cholerae*.

If you look at two of the triangles (representing lineages) at the ends of the branches, e.g. the triangles representing 7PET and Classical, and trace
back along two branches from right to left, you will eventually reach an 'internal node' where those branches meet, further to the left in the tree. This internal
node represents the last common ancestor of the two lineages, e.g.
the last common ancestor of 7PET and Classical (red circle), which is estimated to have lived about 1880 (`Feng et al 2008`_). On the other hand,
the last common ancestor of 7PET and ELA-3 (yellow circle) lived even longer ago.

.. _Feng et al 2008: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19115014/

What the tree tells us is that 7PET and Classical, the two lineages that have caused pandemics, are relatively closely related *V. cholerae* lineages. 
7PET is also relatively closely related to non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae*, including MX-2, Gulf Coast and ELA-3. 

Practically 100% of 7PET isolates produce cholera toxin. Some isolates from non-epidemic lineages are also predicted to produce cholera toxin (because they have the genes encoding cholera toxin; `Chun et al 2009`_, `Domman et al 2017`_; `Hao et al 2023`_), especially isolates from lineages that are relatively closely related to
7PET, such as MX-2 and Gulf Coast (Figure 13).

Later in the course you will be learning a lot about how to build phylogenetic trees yourself, and how to interpret
them to investigate the relationships between different sublineages of 7PET that have caused different 7PET outbreaks, and to
gain insights into how 7PET is spreading regionally and globally. You will see that it is often very interesting and informative to display information
beside a phylogenetic tree; for example, in Figure 13 we plotted presence/absence of particular genes. We can also display additional
non-genetic data that we have about the isolates (known as **'metadata'**), such as the exact location or date of collection of the isolates, or
the serogroup or antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of isolates as determined by laboratory tests.

The Revised GTFCC Definitions of Cholera Cases and Cholera-free Country Statuses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WHO's Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) is a partnership of more
than 50 institutions, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academic institutions, and United Nations (UN) agencies,
that are working together to eliminate cholera. By 2030 they aim to reduce 
cholera deaths by at least 90%, and to eliminate cholera altogether in 20
countries (see the `GTFCC Roadmap 2030`_).

.. _GTFCC Roadmap 2030: https://www.gtfcc.org/about-cholera/roadmap-2030/

Because non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* are found in many countries around
the world, the GTFCC have recently revised their definition of the disease 'cholera'
to specifically mention the epidemic-causing lineage 7PET.
That is, they define cholera as: 

*"disease caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139, carrying the ctxAB genes encoding the cholera toxin (CT), linked to the seventh pandemic lineage or any lineage that might emerge with similar properties"* (`GTFCC 2022`_).

.. _GTFCC 2022: https://www.gtfcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7th-meeting-of-the-gtfcc-working-group-on-surveillance-2022-report.pdf

As mentioned above, non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae* such as MX-2 sometimes cause small outbreaks of mild diarrhoea,
but these are considered of relatively minor public health importance compared to outbreaks caused by 7PET.
The GTFCC is aiming to eliminate 7PET in 20 countries by 2030,
not to eliminate all diarrhoeal illness caused by non-epidemic *V. cholerae*. 
This means that in order to prove that
a particular country has become 'cholera-free', there will need to be
sufficient data to show that diarrhoeal illness caused by 7PET has definitely disappeared from that country. 
One type of data that will be very useful for this purpose is whole-genome sequencing data for *V. cholerae*, which
can be used to accurately distinguish 7PET from non-epidemic lineages of *V. cholerae*, as we will discuss
later in this course. 

Brief Summary
-------------

The key take-home messages of this chapter are:

* Cholera, a disease characterised by acute watery diarrhoea, is caused by ingestion of *Vibrio cholerae*
* Cholera toxin is the most important virulence factor of *V. cholerae*; cholera toxin triggers acute watery diarrhoea
* *V. cholerae* is distributed globally, and is a very diverse species with many different lineages 
* At present there is only one lineage that causes pandemic/epidemic cholera: 7PET, an extremely infectious and virulent lineage
* The genome of a typical 7PET isolate has 4 million base-pairs (4 Mb) of DNA, and contains about 4000 genes
* Practically all 7PET isolates have the genes that encode cholera toxin (genes *ctxA* and *ctxB*)
* A 7PET outbreak requires a rapid and large public health response to halt/reduce it, e.g. WASH, treatment centres, vaccination
* Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to determine whether a new outbreak of diarrhoeal illness is caused by 7PET 

Glossary of Key Terms for Module 1
----------------------------------

* **7PET**: the name of the current pandemic lineage of *Vibrio cholerae*. 7PET is the lineage of *V. cholerae* that has been responsible for all major outbreaks and epidemics of cholera since the 1960s. '7PET' is short for 'Seventh Pandemic El Tor' because 7PET has caused the 7th historically recorded cholera pandemic, and isolates of the 7PET lineage have the El Tor biotype (a laboratory phenotype). 
* **Biotype**: a subgroup of *V. cholerae* bacteria that display a particular phenotype upon a certain set of biochemical laboratory tests. The biotype phenotype has been used historically to predict whether isolates of the *V. cholerae* causing a particular outbreak belong to the epidemic-causing 7PET lineage.
* **Biotype variants**: biotypes which differ in a small number of the laboratory test results that are used to identify the El Tor biotype.
* **Cholera**: a disease characterised by acute watery diarrhoea, which is caused by ingestion of *Vibrio cholerae*.
* **Cholera case**: a patient diagnosed with cholera using standard criteria; see the `WHO 2023`_ guidance and definitions for what they consider 'a suspected cholera case' and 'a confirmed cholera case'.
* **Cholera-endemic area**: see 'endemic'.
* **Cholera toxin (Ctx, CTX, or CT)**: the most important virulence factor of *Vibrio cholerae*; cholera toxin triggers acute watery diarrhoea.
* **Clone**: a group of cells produced asexually from one ancestor, to which they are genetically identical (or nearly identical).
* **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)**: the molecule that carries genetic information of an organism.
* **Endemic**: according to the `CDC website`_, an 'endemic' refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area. The WHO defines a 'cholera-endemic area' as "an area where confirmed cholera cases were detected during the last 3 years with evidence of local transmission (meaning the cases are not imported from elsewhere)" (`WHO 2024`_, accessed 18th July 2024). 
* **Epidemic**: an unexpected increase in the number of disease cases in a specific geographical area (definition from the `CDC website`_). An epidemic is considered to occur of a larger geographic area than an outbreak. See the WHO's detailed technical guidance (`WHO 2023`_) for precise definitions of what they consider to be 'a suspected cholera case', 'a confirmed cholera case', 'a suspected cholera outbreak', 'a probable cholera outbreak', or 'a confirmed cholera outbreak'.
* **Epidemic-causing lineage of V. cholerae**: a *V. cholerae* lineage that can cause a very large increase in the number of cases of diarrhoeal illness caused by *V. cholerae* in a particular town/city/region over a relatively short period of time. The 7PET lineage is the only epidemic-causing lineage of *V. cholerae* at present.
* **Gene**: a segment of the DNA of an organism, typically hundreds or thousands of base-pairs in length. A very common type of gene is a protein-coding gene, which is a stretch of DNA which encodes (specifies the production of) a particular protein. 
* **Genome**: all the genetic material present in a cell or organism.
* **Isolate**: an organism collected from a specific sample material e.g. from a stool sample or from river water. 
* **Lineage**: a group of organisms belonging to the same bacterial species, and that are genetically more closely related to each other than other members of the same species. There can be many lineages within a particular bacterial species. Different lineages of a bacterial species may have different biological characteristics, such as the ability to cause more severe disease. (Adapted from a definition by the `National Cancer Institute`_.)
* **Metadata**: non-genetic data that has been collected for bacterial isolates, such as the exact location or date of collection of the isolates.
* **Mutation**: a change in the genetic material of an organism, caused by a change its DNA (e.g. the change of single base-pair in its DNA).
* **O-antigen**: a component of the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria such as *V. cholerae*. 
* **Outbreak**: an unexpected increase in the number of disease cases in a specific geographical area (definition from the `CDC website`_). An outbreak is considered to occur of a smaller geographic area than an epidemic.  See the WHO's detailed technical guidance (`WHO 2023`_) for precise definitions of what they consider to be 'a suspected cholera case', 'a confirmed cholera case', 'a suspected cholera outbreak', 'a probable cholera outbreak', or 'a confirmed cholera outbreak'.
* **Pandemic**: an epidemic that has spread over several countries and usually affects many people (definition from the `CDC website`_).
* **Pandemic lineage**: a lineage of a bacterial species that is causing or caused a pandemic of a disease.
* **Phylogenetic tree**: a diagram that depicts the evolutionary relationships between particular organisms, and how they descended from a common ancestor.
* **Serogroup**: a subgroup of *V. cholerae* bacteria that share the same distinctive surface structure in their O-antigen, and so have the same laboratory phenotype when exposed to host antibodies specific for that particular type of O-antigen.
* **Strain**: see 'lineage'. Also used to refer to a single bacterial isolate that has been cultured over time in a laboratory.
* **Toxigenic V. cholerae**: *V. cholerae* that produces the cholera toxin. Isolates of the 7PET lineage are toxigenic, but a small fraction of isolates of some other lineages of *V. cholerae* are also toxigenic.
* **Variant biotype**: See 'biotype variants'.
* **Viable but Non-Culturable (VBNC)**: a dormant state that many bacterial species enter under unfavourable conditions such as low temperature and low nutrient conditions.
* **Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae)**: a curved Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that causes the disease cholera.
* **Virulence factor**: a protein (or protein complex) that helps a bacterium to colonise a host at the cellular level.
* **Whole genome sequencing (WGS)**: the process of determining the DNA sequence of an organism's whole genome.
