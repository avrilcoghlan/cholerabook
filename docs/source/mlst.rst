*Vibrio cholerae* lineage information
=====================================

In this section, we will describe how you can:

* `Carry out MLST analysis of your isolate`_.
* `Compare your isolate to Vibriowatch's reference genomes`_.
* `Build a phylogenetic tree to check if your isolate belongs to the pandemic lineage`_.

Carry out MLST analysis of your isolate
---------------------------------------

Vibriowatch uses the *Vibrio cholerae* MLST (multi-locus sequence typing) scheme of `Octavia et al 2013`_, which is based on seven housekeeping genes.

.. _Octavia et al 2013: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23776471/

To view MLST information for your isolate's genome, you can look at the top of the 'report page' for your isolate in Vibriowatch.
An example of the top of a report page is shown here:

In the example above, the isolate is classified as MLST sequence type ST69, based on its sequence at the seven housekeeping genes (ie. *adk*, *gyrB*, *mdh*, *metE*, *pntA*, *purM*, *pyrC*). The allele at each gene in the MLST scheme is given, e.g. this isolate has allele 7 of gene *adk*. ST69 is one of the STs (sequence types) seen for the current pandemic lineage of *Vibrio cholerae*, so this suggests that this isolate belongs to the pandemic lineage.

Another sequence type that is sometimes seen for pandemic lineage *V. cholerae* is ST515 (see `Cheney et al 2021`_).

.. _Cheney et al 2021: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427512/

Sometimes you will see that the sequence type of an isolate does not start with 'ST', but instead with a '*' symbol, e.g. '*1109' or '*7bc5'. This means that it is a novel sequence type that has not been included in the *V. cholerae* MLST scheme.
